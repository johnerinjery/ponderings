      Hello, Reader. My name is
      <a href="https://johnerinjery.github.io/">John Erinjery</a>. You can find
      more about me elsewhere, in this space I try to summarize a lot of my
      <em>Ponderings.</em>In <em>Ponderings</em> I will share the fruits of my
      thinking sessions on many things, some prominent, others rather obscure.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made this space for myself simply due to the fact that I am motivated to
      organize my thoughts and summize them as I am trying to write them up.
      More often than not, I tend to forget the various trains of thought I had
      a few weeks in the past, this website was my rather efficiency driven
      solution for the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have tried to categorize topics the best I can; Some of these are truly
      trivial - please amuse me.
    </p>
