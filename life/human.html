      Hello, Reader. In this page I want to share my <em>Ponderings</em> on
      Human. Imporant it is to note that I revise these texts if I learn
      something that changes my prespective drastically. One has to be ready for
      change at all times after all. However, everything you read here are my
      thoughts which I have tried to be very critical about.

      Standing on a busy roadside, looking at a Woodpecker perched on a close by
      power line, I found myself thinking about Life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oftentimes I have found, when we think deeply about something
      philosophical, we tend to get stuck by the word we use to describe what we
      are thinking about. By this I mean, say we are thinking about happiness.
      What is happiness? When is someone really happy? How do we find happiness?
      When we think about all this, we oftentimes subconsciously come back to
      the textbook definition of the word happiness. If the quest was to find
      out the meaning of the word happiness, it would not be a quest at all –
      the word is very well defined in a standard lexicon. If this definition
      was whole and satisfactory, then the question ‘What is Happiness?’ would
      not have any merit. But none of us thinks that is the case, do we? We can
      hence conclude that all of us Humans have a subconscious understanding
      that a definition in words is not sufficient to fully describe an emotion
      like happiness. A word is a label – but I argue people sometimes tend to
      think more about the word than the experience when they think about it and
      try to answer the question of what it is. When this happens, we find
      ourselves trapped in self-references, and thinking stalls. The same is
      even truer for Life.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is Life, is a question that has persisted even with centuries of
      definitions. If asked, most people list biological checklists and lexical
      definitions, but I have yet to find someone who is satisfied with the
      answer they themselves give. The problem of course is similar to what we
      discussed about happiness above. Something as magnificent and beautifully
      complex as Life, I feel like it would be degrading to give it a
      definition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence, I decided to stop trying to answer What is Life. I thought it would
      be more productive to think, Why am I Living. Again, what is the purpose
      of life is a question that has stood since the dawn of mankind; However, I
      believe the reason for this is much simpler. Every generation lives in a
      world that none of the previous generation lived in. Everything changes.
      People change, thinking change even the landscape changes. Inevitably even
      the gist of what the purpose of life is will change over the generations.
    </p>
    <p>
      A clear distinction between what makes humans different from other animals
      is a starting point for our discussion. I felt it would be better if I
      approach the purpose of life starting from this distinction.
